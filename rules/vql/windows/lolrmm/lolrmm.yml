title: RMM Bluetrait (Pslist)
description: |
   Bluetrait is a Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tool designed to provide IT administrators and Managed Service Providers (MSPs) with remote access, system monitoring, and automation capabilities across Windows, Linux, and macOS devices. Like many RMM solutions, Bluetrait enables seamless remote management, allowing administrators to execute commands, install software, and troubleshoot issues without direct user intervention.
   
   However, Proofpoint's research has highlighted how threat actors are increasingly abusing RMM tools, including Bluetrait, for malicious purposes. Attackers leverage Bluetrait as part of their post-exploitation strategy, often deploying it through phishing or social engineering techniques. Once installed, Bluetrait allows attackers to establish persistent remote access, circumvent traditional security controls, and execute malicious payloads under the guise of legitimate administrative activity.

title: RMM Bluetrait (filesystem)
description: |
   Bluetrait is a Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tool designed to provide IT administrators and Managed Service Providers (MSPs) with remote access, system monitoring, and automation capabilities across Windows, Linux, and macOS devices. Like many RMM solutions, Bluetrait enables seamless remote management, allowing administrators to execute commands, install software, and troubleshoot issues without direct user intervention.
   
   However, Proofpoint's research has highlighted how threat actors are increasingly abusing RMM tools, including Bluetrait, for malicious purposes. Attackers leverage Bluetrait as part of their post-exploitation strategy, often deploying it through phishing or social engineering techniques. Once installed, Bluetrait allows attackers to establish persistent remote access, circumvent traditional security controls, and execute malicious payloads under the guise of legitimate administrative activity.
