Generally speaking, when Sysmon EventID 10 cannot reference a stack call to a dll loaded from disk (the standard way),\nit will display \"UNKNOWN\" as the module name. Usually this means the stack call points to a module that was reflectively loaded in memory.\nAdding to this, it is not common to see such few calls in the stack (ntdll.dll --\u003e kernelbase.dll --\u003e unknown) which essentially means that\nmost of the functions required by the process to execute certain routines are already present in memory, not requiring any calls to external libraries.\nThe latter should also be considered suspicious.\n","author":"Perez Diego (@darkquassar), oscd.community, Jonhnathan Ribeiro","link":"hayabusa/sigma/sysmon/deprecated/proc_access_win_in_memory_assembly_execution.yml","tags":["logsource:*/windows/sysmon"]},{"title":"Pubprn.vbs Proxy Execution 2","description":"Detects the use of the 'Pubprn.vbs' Microsoft signed script to execute commands.","author":"frack113","link":"hayabusa/sigma/sysmon/process_creation/proc_creation_win_lolbin_pubprn.yml","tags":["logsource:*/windows/sysmon"]},{"title":"Sdclt Child Processes 2","description":"A General detection for sdclt spawning new processes.
